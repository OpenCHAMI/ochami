# DATA STRUCTURE

cloud-init uses different data structures in its API, depending on the endpoint.

## CLUSTER DEFAULTS

Certain values can be set to be used as fallback (default) values if not set by
any group or node. This structure is used with the
*/cloud-init/admin/cluster-defaults* endpoint.

An example of a structure of default values in JSON format is:

```
{
  "availability-zone": "string",
  "base-url": "http://demo.openchami.cluster:8081/cloud-init",
  "boot-subnet": "string",
  "cloud_provider": "string",
  "cluster-name": "demo",
  "nid-length": 3,
  "public-keys": [
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMLtQNuzGcMDatF+YVMMkuxbX2c5v2OxWftBhEVfFb+U user1@demo-head",
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB4vVRvkzmGE5PyWX2fuzJEgEfET4PRLHXCnD1uFZ8ZL user2@demo-head"
  ],
  "region": "string",
  "short-name": "nid",
  "wg-subnet": "string"
}
```

## GROUP DATA

Group data contains, unsurprisingly, data for a group.

This structure is used for the */cloud-init/admin/groups* family of endpoints.

It has a *name* and *description* describing the group itself. There is also
*file* which contains the cloud-init configuration file for the group, which can
either be encoded plainly (*"encoding": "plain"*) or via base64 (*"encoding":
"base64"*). *content* contains the actual cloud-init configuration contents,
formatted as the value of *encoding*. *meta-data* contains key-value pairs
representing variables for the group that can be used in cloud-init configs if
it uses Jinja2 templating.

An example of a group data structure in JSON format:

```
{
  "description": "The compute group",
  "file": {
    "content": "IyMgdGVtcGxhdGU6IGppbmphCiNjbG91ZC1jb25maWcKbWVyZ2VfaG93OgotIG5hbWU6IGxpc3QKICBzZXR0aW5nczogW2FwcGVuZF0KLSBuYW1lOiBkaWN0CiAgc2V0dGluZ3M6IFtub19yZXBsYWNlLCByZWN1cnNlX2xpc3RdCnVzZXJzOgogIC0gbmFtZTogcm9vdAogICAgc3NoX2F1dGhvcml6ZWRfa2V5czoge3sgZHMubWV0YV9kYXRhLmluc3RhbmNlX2RhdGEudjEucHVibGljX2tleXMgfX0KZGlzYWJsZV9yb290OiBmYWxzZQo=",
    "encoding": "base64",
    "filename": "cloud-config.yaml"
  },
  "meta-data": {
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "name": "compute"
}
```

## NODE META-DATA

Node-specific meta-data is used with the
*/cloud-init/impersonation/{id}/meta-data* and */cloud-init/meta-data*
endpoints. The structure represents all of the cloud-init meta-data for a
specific node, aggregated from group- and node-specific configs.

An example in JSON format is:

```
{
  "cluster-name": "demo",
  "hostname": "compute-1.demo.openchami.cluster",
  "instance-data": {
    "v1": {
      "availability-zone": "string",
      "cloud-name": "string",
      "cloud-provider": "string",
      "hostname": "string",
      "instance-id": "string",
      "instance-type": "string",
      "local-hostname": "string",
      "local-ipv4": "string",
      "public-keys": [
        "AAA[..snip...] user1@demo.openchami.cluster"
      ],
      "region": "string",
      "vendor-data": {
        "cabinet": "string",
        "cloud-init-base-url": "string",
        "cluster_name": "demo",
        "groups": {
          "compute": {
            "description": "The compute group"
          },
        },
        "location": "string",
        "nid": 0,
        "rack": "string",
        "role": "string",
        "sub-role": "string",
        "version": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "instance-id": "string",
  "local-hostname": "compute-1"
}
```

## NODE USER-DATA

Node-specific user-data is used with the */cloud-init/impersonation/{id}/user-data* and */cloud-init/user-data* endpoints. In the OpenCHAMI cloud-init server, user-data is always empty and is not used.

For example, any node that requests its user-data will get the following back:

```
#cloud-config
```

## NODE VENDOR-DATA

Node-specific vendor-data is used with the
*/cloud-init/impersonation/{id}/vendor-data* and */cloud-init/vendor-data*
endpoints. In the OpenCHAMI cloud-init server, the purpose of vendor-data is to
generate a list of group data to include for the node.

For instance, if a node is a member of the *compute* and *slurm* groups and it
requests its vendor-data, the following cloud-init data is returned:

```
#include
http://172.16.0.254:8081/cloud-init/compute.yaml
http://172.16.0.254:8081/cloud-init/slurm.yaml
```

# GLOBAL FLAGS

The *cloud-init* command accepts the following global flags:

*--uri* _uri_
	Specify either the absolute base URI for the service (e.g.
	_https://foobar.openchami.cluster:8443/hsm/v2_) or a relative base path for
	the service (e.g. _/hsm/v2_). If an absolute URI is specified, this
	completely overrides any value set with the *--cluster-uri* flag or
	*cluster.uri* in the config file for the cluster. If using an absolute URI,
	it should contain the desired service's base path. If a relative path is
	specified (with or without the leading forward slash), then this value
	overrides the service's default base path and is appended to the cluster's
	base URI (set with the *--cluster-uri* flag or the *cluster.uri* cluster
	config option), which is required to be set if a relative path is used here.

	See *ochami*(1) for *--cluster-uri* and *ochami-config*(5) for details on
	cluster configuration options.

	*-f, --format-input* _format_
		Format of raw data being used by *-d* as the payload. Supported formats
		are:

		- _json_ (default)
		- _json-pretty_
		- _yaml_

*get*
	Get cloud-init group data.

	Commands under this one send one or more GET requests to the
	*/cloud-init/admin/groups* or */cloud-init/admin/groups/{id}* endpoints.

	This command has the following subcommands:

	*config* [--header _when_] [_group_name_...]
		Print the cloud-init config file for one or more groups, identified by
		one or more _group_name_ arguments. If none are passed, the
		configurations for all known groups are printed.

		If more than one is printed, a header is printed for each that
		identifies which ID each belongs to, as well as how many configs are
		being printed. This behavior can be modified with the *--header* flag.
		An example of the header is:

		```
		(1/5) group=compute
		```

		*1* is the index being printed, *5* is the total that are being printed,
		and *compute* is the id of the group being printed.

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*--header* _when_
			When to print headers. Supported values are:

			- _always_
			- _multiple_ (default)
			- _never_

			A value of _multiple_  means that the headers will only be printed
			when there are more than one items in the output.

	*meta-data* [-F _format_] [_group_name_...]
		Print the meta-data keys and values for one or more groups, identified
		by one or more _group_name_ arguments. If none are passed, the meta-data
		for all known groups is printed.

		The output is an array of objects each with two keys: *name* and
		*meta-data*, for example, in JSON format:

		```
		[
			{
				"name": "group1",
				"meta-data": {
					"foo": "bar"
				}
			},
			...
		]
		```

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*-F, --format-output* _format_
			Format the response output as _format_.

			Supported values are:

			- _json_ (default)
			- _json-pretty_
			- _yaml_

	*raw* [-F _format_] [_group_name_...]
		Print the raw group data for one or more groups, identified by one or
		more _group_name_ arguments. If none are passed, the raw data for all
		known groups is printed. The data returned is an array of group data
		objects (see *GROUP DATA*).

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*-F, --format-output* _format_
			Format the response output as _format_.

			Supported values are:

			- _json_ (default)
			- _json-pretty_
			- _yaml_

*render* _group_name_ _node_id_
	Print the cloud-init group configuration for _group_name_, impersonating
	node _node_id_, populating Jinja2 variables. _node_id_ must be a member of
	group _group_name_. This command is similar to the *cloud-init get config*
	command except that (1) Jinja2 variables are populated and (2) only one
	config at a time can be printed.

	This command works by fetching the group config for _group_name_ and
	_node_id_ (*cloud-init node get group*), fetching the meta-data for
	_node_id_ (*cloud-init node get meta-data*), then using the meta-data to
	render the group config locally. Note that this command only renders the
	group configuration for a node and does not go through cloud-init's full
	render process.

	This command is meant as a troubleshooting tool.

	This command sends GET requests to the following cloud-init endpoints:

	- */cloud-init/admin/impersonation/{id}/{group}.yaml*
	- */cloud-init/admin/impersonation/{id}/meta-data*

*set* [-f _format_] < _file_++
*set* [-f _format_] -d @_file_++
*set* [-f _format_] -d @- < _file_++
*set* [-f _format_] -d _data_
	Set cloud-init group data for one or more groups, creating the group if
	non-existent or overwriting group data if the group exists. This command
	only accepts an array of group data (see *GROUP DATA*) and uses the *name*
	field to determine which groups to update.

	In the first and third forms of the command, data is read from standard
	input.

	In the second form of the command, a file containing the payload data is
	passed. This is convenient for dealing with many cloud-init configurations
	at once.

	In the fourth form of the command, the payload is passed raw on the command
	line. This data is passed raw to the server.

	This command sends a PUT to the */cloud-init/admin/groups* endpoint.

	This command accepts the following options:

	*-d, --data* (_data_ | @_path_ | @-)
		Specify raw _data_ to send, the _path_ to a file to read payload data
		from, or to read the data from standard input (@-). The format of data
		read in any of these forms is JSON by default unless *-f* is specified
		to change it.

	*-f, --format-input* _format_
		Format of raw data being used by *-d* as the payload. Supported formats
		are:

		- _json_ (default)
		- _json-pretty_
		- _yaml_

## node

Get and manage cloud-init node data.

Subcommands for this command are as follows:

*get*
	Get cloud-init node data. This command has the following subcommands:

	*group* [--header _when_] _node_id_ _group_name_...
		Print the cloud-init group data for _node_id_ for each group
		_group_name_ that it is a member of.

		If more than one is printed, a header is printed for each that
		identifies which group and node ID combination is being printed, as well
		as how many configs are being printed. This behavior can be modified
		with the *--header* flag. An example of the header
		is:

		```
		--- (1/5) node=x3000c0s0b0n0 group=compute
		```

		*1* is the index being printed and *5* is the total that are being
		printed. *node=x3000c0s0b0n0 group=compute* means that the config being
		printed is the group *compute* config for node *x3000c0s0b0n0*.

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*--header* _when_
			When to print headers. Supported values are:

			- _always_
			- _multiple_ (default)

			A value of _multiple_  means that the headers will only be printed
			when there are more than one items in the output.

	*meta-data* [-F _format_] _node_id_...
		Print the meta-data keys and values for one or more nodes, identified by
		_node_id_. At least one _node_id_ is required. The result of this
		command is an array of node meta-data structures (see *NODE META-DATA*).

		This command sends a GET to the
		*/cloud-init/admin/impersonation/{id}/meta-data* endpoint.

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*-F, --format-output* _format_

			- _json-pretty_
			- _yaml_

	*user-data* [--header _when_] _node_id_...
		Print the user-data for one or more nodes, identified by _node_id_. At
		least one _node_id_ is required. The result of this command is
		cloud-init user-data (see *NODE USER-DATA*).

		If more than one is printed, a header is printed for each that
		identifies which ID each belongs to, as well as how many configs are
		being printed. This behavior can be modified with the *--header* flag.
		An example of the header is:

		```
		(1/5) node=x3000c0s0b0n0
		```

		*1* is the index being printed, *5* is the total that are being printed,
		and *x3000c0s0b0n0* is the id of the node being printed.

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*--header* _when_
			When to print headers. Supported values are:

			- _always_
			- _multiple_ (default)
			- _never_

		If more than one is printed, a header is printed for each that
		identifies which ID each belongs to, as well as how many configs are
		being printed. This behavior can be modified with the *--header* flag.
		An example of the header is:

		```
		(1/5) node=x3000c0s0b0n0
		```

		*1* is the index being printed, *5* is the total that are being printed,
		and *x3000c0s0b0n0* is the id of the node being printed.

		This command accepts the following flags:

		*--header* _when_
			When to print headers. Supported values are:

			- _always_
			- _multiple_ (default)

*set* [-f _format_] -d @- < _file_++
*set* [-f _format_] -d _data_
	Set node-specific meta-data for one or more nodes. This command only accepts

	determine which nodes whose data to set.

	In the first and third forms of the command, data is read from standard
	input.

	In the second form of the command, a file containing the payload data is
	passed. This is convenient for dealing with many cloud-init node instance
	info at once.
